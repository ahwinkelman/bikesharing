 # Overview
This project shows the Tableau's ability to visualize spreadsheets with minimal coding knowledge.  Tableau can break down data and be formatted with a simple drag and drop.  This is a great tool to use for users who are not techincally strong and can help them visualize their data in an interactive way.

# Results
This Tableau story https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.winkelman6563/viz/CitiBikeChallenge_16628251899290/Story1?publish=yes gives several visualizations of data breaking down usage by hour, day, gender, user type, and popular locations. Please dive into the tableau story book for yourself!



# Summary
Two other uses that could be studied for this data are:
Start and End locations during rush hour traffic to help people plan their commutes
Trip duration based on Age to see if there is a trend for which gender or age group duration of rides.
